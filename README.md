# Ice Builder for MSBuild

The Ice Builder for MSBuild provides support for compiling Slice source files
(`.ice` files) within C++ and C# MSBuild projects. It compiles these Slice files
using the Slice to C++ compiler (`slice2cpp`) or the Slice to C# compiler (`slice2cs`)
provided by your Ice  installation.

Ice Builder compiles or recompiles a Slice file when the corresponding generated
files are missing or when they are out of date. Generated files are out of date
when they are older than the corresponding Slice source file, or when they are older
than any Slice file included directly or indirectly by this Slice source file.

The Ice Builder for MSBuild requires Ice 3.6.0 or higher, and MSBuild 4.0 or higher.

## Installation

To install Ice Builder, you just need to add the `zeroc.icebuilder.msbuild` [NuGet package](1)
to your C++ or C# MSBuild project.

For C++ projects, `zeroc.icebuilder.msbuild` inserts its `SliceCompile` task before the
default `Compile` task, and inserts its `SliceClean` task before the default `Clean` task.
`SliceCompile` generates C++ code using `slice2cpp` and adds the generated C++ files to
the `ClCompile` items.

For C# projects, `zeroc.icebuilder.msbuild` inserts its `SliceCompile` task before the
default `Compile` task, and inserts its `SliceClean` task before the default `Clean` task.
`SliceCompile` generates C# code using `slice2cs` and adds the generated C# files to
the C# `Compile` items.

## Selecting your Ice Installation 

The Ice Builder for MSBuild relies on the following MSBuild properties to locate
and validate your Ice installation:

| Property      | Description                             | Used for                                                            |
| --------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IceHome       | Root directory of your Ice installation | `$(IceHome)/slice`, the Slice files of your Ice installation        |
| IceToolsPath  | Directory of `slice2cpp` and `slice2cs` | Compiling Slice files into C++ or C#                                |
| IceIntVersion | Ice version as an integer               | Making sure you are using a version of Ice supported by Ice Builder |

The default value for `IceHome` is usually correct, in which case you don't need to set
`IceHome` explicitly.  When Ice is provided by a NuGet package, `IceHome` always points
to the NuGet package installation. Otherwise, the default value for `IceHome` depends on
your platform:

| Platform | Default IceHome (non NuGet installation)|
| -------- |  -------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | Read from the Windows Registry<br>`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ZeroC\IceBuilder\IceHome`<br>usually set by the [Ice Builder for Visual Studio](2) |
| Linux    | `/usr/share/ice`                        |
| macOS    | `/usr/local/opt/ice`                    |

The default value for `IceToolsPath` is also usually correct:

| Platform                  | Default IceToolsPath     |
| --------------------------|  ----------------------- |
| Windows with Ice NuGet    | The NuGet's tools folder |
| Windows without Ice NuGet | `$(IceHome)\bin`         |
| Linux                     | `/usr/bin`               |
| macOS                     | `/usr/local/bin`         |

## C++ Usage

## C# Usage

## Building from Source

### Build Requirements

You need Visual Studio 2017 and the [Visual Studio 2017 SDK](3).

### Build Instructions

Open Visual Studio Command prompt and run the following command:

```
MSBuild icebuilder.proj /t:NuGetPack
```

You can sign the assembly with Authenticode by setting the environment variable `SIGN_CERTIFICATE` to
the path of your PFX certificate store, and the `SIGN_PASSWORD` environment variable to the password
used by your certificate store.
